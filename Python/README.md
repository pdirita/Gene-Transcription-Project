# Determination of Transcription Factor ControlStrength and Activity Values from TranscriptionFactor Deletion Expression Data

### Prerequisites

To properly run the Jupyter notebook, ensure the following packages are installed and up-to-date:
* Python 3
* JupyterLab
* Scipy
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

## Running the tests

* Open optimize_notebook.ipynb in JupyterLab
* At the top of JupyterLab, click Run -> Run All Cells
* Allow the program to run. This can take a fair amount of time
    * The CG solver takes significantly more time to converge than the rest, allow it to continue running if it appears to hang
* All relevant outputs will be visible once the script has completed
    * The graphs and table can be found at the bottom of the notebook
